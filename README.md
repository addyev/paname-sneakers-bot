# paname-sneakers-bot
Open-sourcing my Sneakers Raffle Bot, paname.io. 

## Goal
The main goal of this project was to create a noob friendly sneakers bot, taking care of proxies, recaptcha solving, thus abstracting the laborious side-tasks when using a bot.    

## Features
- A few bots for well known websites (Typeform, Google Form, ...)
- reCaptcha & hCaptcha integrated resolver
- Complete typed API & Frontend
- Testing with Jest
- Dashboard with tasks support and integrated payment gateway with Stripe

## Installation 
Each part of the project has its own installation process.
